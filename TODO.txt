TO DO:

07.18.19:

Notes from call with antonio:

1) Things to Check:

# Proportions for the Lemma was wrong.

	[DONE] Should be ok after I refactor the code.

# Check to make sure Keywords are working the right way

	[DONE] Also should be ok after I refactor the code.

# Stems may not be gathering the terms enough.

	[DONE] We may have to do some custome Steming or Custom Lemmaing.

# Is there a way to make the scales all the same on the keyword changes graahs?

  [DONE] I have done this but we may not want to.

# Is there a way to color the Keyword Changes graph by the Keyword Categories or rearrange them?

  [DONE] The categories are not disjoint sets. Some keywords (like "trabajo"") appear in two different categories.
    So there is no clear way to color each of the sub-graphs by category.

# Reduce the "signature graph" for keywords to the top 10.

  [DONE] This has been Done

2) Graphs to Include:

- Proportion Graph for all Lemmas

- Keyword Changes Graphs

- Both of the "Signature Graphs"


3) What I need to Write:

Literature Review for Techniques

Description of how the graphs were created from gathering the text to the graph.
