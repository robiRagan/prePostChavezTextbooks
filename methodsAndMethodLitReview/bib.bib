@article{Cox1990,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates how electoral laws affect the position-taking incentives of parties and candidates. It seeks to extend the finding presented in the classical "median voter theorem" to a wide class of electoral systems--or to show the limits of such extension. The factors examined are the district magnitude, the electoral formula, the number of votes each voter is allowed to cast, whether voters can cumulate their votes, and whether voters can "partially abstain." I suggest a crude division of electoral systems into those producing predominantly centripetal incentives and those producing predominantly centrifugal incentives. Among the factors found to produce centripetal incentives, at least in noncumulative systems, are the following: increases in the number of votes per voter; outlawry of "partial abstention"; and decreases in the district magnitude. In systems allowing the cumulation of votes, matters are a bit different.},

	between the two chambers, and across Congress more broadly is central
	to explaining the dynamics of gridlock. To test the model, I construct
	a measure that assesses legislative output in proportion to the policy
	agenda. Using newspaper editorials to identify every salient legislative
	issue between 1947 and 1996, I generate Congress-by-Congress gridlock
	scores and use them to test competing explanations. The results suggest

@article{Cox1996,
	Abstract = {A simple rational entry argument suggests that the value of incumbency
	consists not just of a direct effect, reflecting the value of resources
	(such as staff) attached to legislative office, but also of an indirect
	effect, reflecting the fact that stronger challengers are less likely
	to contest incumbent-held seats. The indirect effect is the product
	of a scare-off effect--the ability of incumbents to scare off high-quality
	challengers--and a quality effect--reflecting how much electoral
	advantage a party accrues when it has an experienced rather than
	an inexperienced candidate. The growth of the overall incumbency
	advantage was driven principally by increases in the quality effect.
	We use a simple two-equation model, estimated by ordinary least-squares
	regression, to analyze U.S. House election data from 1948 to 1990.
	Most of the increase in the incumbency advantage, at least down to
	1980, came through increases in the quality effect (i.e., the advantage
	to the incumbent party of having a low-quality challenger). This
	suggests that the task for those wishing to explain the growth in
	the vote-denominated incumbency advantage is to explain why the quality
	effect grew. It also suggests that resource-based explanations of
	the growth in the incumbency advantage cannot provide a full explanation.},

	take a new perspective on the divided government debate by emphasizing
	the important role that the federal bureaucracy plays in shaping
	policy. We present a game theoretic model of the policy-making process
	in which legislators design administrative procedures, the president
	appoints agency heads, and bureaucrats collect information and promulgate
	regulations. The model predicts that during times of divided control
	Congress delegates less discretionary authority to the executive
	branch, and that these changes in authority have significant policy
	consequences. We then test the implications of our model with data
	drawn from U.S. trade policy between 1890 and 1990. Our central finding
	is that divided government influences policy indirectly, through
	the procedures that Congress designs to control the bureaucracy.},

	Abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of income distribution on growth when
	investment in human capital is the source of growth and individuals
	vote over the degree of redistribution in the economy. The model
	has three main features. First, very different patterns of income
	distribution are conducive to high growth at different levels of
	per capita income. Second, growth is associated with an externality
	whereby investment in human capital by one group increases the productivity
	of other groups, thus potentially enabling them to invest in human
	capital. Third, the initial pattern of income distribution and the
	resulting political equilibrium are crucial in determining whether
	the transmission of this externality is promoted, in which case growth
	is enhanced, or prevented, in which case growth is stopped. Using
	a non-overlapping generations model with voting, I derive several
	empirical implications. In particular, the model implies an inverted-U
	relation between levels of inequality and levels of income in cross-sections,
	but not necessarily in time series, a result that seems consistent
	with a number of empirical studies.},

	less (participatory shirking). Our analysis avoids the pitfalls of

	design contrasting those certain that they are seeking reelection
	with those sure that they are departing the House for the 102nd,
	103rd, and 104th Congresses (1991-1996). We measure changes in ideology
	and participation using all roll-call votes in the last six months
	of election years, controlling for possible member selection effects
	and short-term influences, and show that legislators are disposed
	toward ideological and participatory shirking while selection effects
	are unimportant. Thus, we reconcile results seemingly at odds and
	suggest that policies affecting member turnover, such as term limits,
	can interfere with representation.},
